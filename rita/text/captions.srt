1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,830

00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:11,820

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:17,800

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:20,830
threaten peaceful citizens

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,050
the number of new illegal immigrant

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:26,800
families who have crossed the border so

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:32,169
far this year already exceeds the entire

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:35,829

00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:38,409
by the tens of thousands into our

10
00:00:35,829 --> 00:01:03,340
communities with no regard for the

11
00:00:38,409 --> 00:01:08,920
impact on public safety or resources

12
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:13,450
one such border crosser was released and

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:18,070
made his way to Nebraska there he ended

14
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:23,290
the life of an innocent young girl named

15
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:26,050
Sarah route she was 21 years old and was

16
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:30,460
killed the day after graduating from

17
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:35,110
college with a four-point-oh grade point

and he is now a fugitive from the law

21
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:49,570

22
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:53,410

24
00:01:53,410 --> 00:02:03,030
